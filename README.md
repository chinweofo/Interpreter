This project implements an executor for the Tran language: the Lexer and TextManager scan source text into line/column-tracked tokens (identifiers, numbers, strings, operators, NEWLINE/INDENT/DEDENT), enforcing 4-space indentation; Token/TokenManager provide safe lookahead/removal; and the Parser builds an AST for interfaces, classes, members, constructors, methods, variable declarations, assignments, method calls, if/else, loop, arithmetic and comparison expressions, and new object construction, with precise SyntaxErrorExceptions on violations. The Interpreter then executes that AST: it injects a built-in shared console.write(...) (variadic) method, locates a shared, parameterless start entry point, and performs method/constructor dispatch (including shared methods, instance methods via locals/members, and class lookups), builds and type-instantiates locals/params/returns, evaluates expressions (booleans, numbers, strings with + concatenation, chars, comparisons, variables, method-call expressions, and object creation), assigns results via resolved variable references, and interprets statement blocks (including if/else). The net outcome is a working pipeline that takes raw Tran source → tokens → AST → executed program, with a minimal standard library (console.write) and structured runtime errors for missing symbols, bad matches, or unresolved types.
